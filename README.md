# YNAB MCP Server

A TypeScript MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that connects to the YNAB API for personal budget reporting. Designed to be hosted on Railway and connected to Claude.ai as a custom connector.

## Features

12 read-only tools covering every major YNAB reporting use case:

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `ynab_get_plans` | List all budgets with IDs and names |
| `ynab_get_accounts` | All accounts with balances and types |
| `ynab_get_categories` | Category groups and categories with goal info |
| `ynab_get_months` | All budget months with income/budgeted/activity totals |
| `ynab_get_month_detail` | Full category breakdown for a specific month |
| `ynab_get_transactions` | All transactions with optional date filters |
| `ynab_get_transactions_by_account` | Transactions for a specific account |
| `ynab_get_transactions_by_category` | Transactions for a specific category |
| `ynab_get_transactions_by_payee` | Transactions for a specific payee |
| `ynab_get_payees` | All payees with IDs (for use with filtered queries) |
| `ynab_get_scheduled_transactions` | Upcoming and recurring scheduled transactions |
| `ynab_get_money_movements` | Account-to-account transfers |

## Setup and Deployment

### Step 1 — Generate a YNAB Personal Access Token

1. Log in to YNAB and go to **app.ynab.com/settings/developer**
2. Click **New Token** under Personal Access Tokens
3. Copy the token — you won't see it again

### Step 2 — Deploy to Railway

1. Go to **railway.app** → **New Project** → **Deploy from GitHub repo** → select this repo
2. The `main` branch will be selected by default — leave it as is
3. Open your service → **Variables** tab and add:
   - `YNAB_TOKEN` — your YNAB personal access token from Step 1
   - `SERVER_URL` — your Railway public URL (e.g. `https://your-app.railway.app`). You may need to generate the domain first (Settings → Generate Domain), then come back and add this variable.
4. Railway builds and deploys automatically using `railway.toml`

### Step 3 — Connect to Claude.ai

1. Open Claude.ai → **Settings → Connectors → Add custom connector**
2. Enter your Railway URL with the `/mcp` path:
   ```
   https://your-app.railway.app/mcp
   ```
3. Leave the **OAuth Client ID** and **OAuth Client Secret** fields empty — the server handles registration automatically
4. Click **Add**

Claude.ai will open a page on your Railway server asking **"Authorize YNAB access?"** — click **Approve**. This happens once. After that, Claude.ai holds a token and reconnects silently.

> **Note:** If the server restarts (e.g. after a Railway redeploy), Claude.ai will prompt you to approve again. This is normal — tokens are held in memory.

## Local Development

```bash
npm install
```

Create a `.env` file in the project root (it's gitignored):

```
YNAB_TOKEN=your_ynab_token_here
SERVER_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

Then run:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The server starts on port 3000. Check it's running at `http://localhost:3000/health`.

## Architecture

- **Transport**: Streamable HTTP (MCP spec) with stateful sessions
- **Auth**: OAuth 2.0 with dynamic client registration and PKCE. Claude.ai registers itself automatically; you approve access once in your browser.
- **Amounts**: All monetary values returned in dollars (milliunits ÷ 1000), never raw integers
- **Default budget**: All tools default to `last-used` so you don't need to specify a plan ID

---

## Security

- Your YNAB Personal Access Token is only read from the environment — never committed to code
- All tools are read-only; no write operations are exposed
- Access requires explicit approval in your browser — unapproved requests are rejected
- PKCE prevents authorization codes from being stolen or replayed
- Sessions are isolated per Claude connection
